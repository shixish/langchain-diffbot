"""LangChain integration for Diffbot.

Thin layer over the official `diffbot-python` SDK. Every public class accepts
either a `diffbot_api_token` (or `DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN` env var) or a pre-built
`diffbot.Diffbot` / `diffbot.DiffbotAsync` client via the `client` /
`async_client` fields — anything the SDK can do, you can do via these classes.
